# OVERVIEW
The aim of the analysis is to clean the data so that it is correct and suitable for analysis so as to provide insights into the sales performance of the company over the years.By analysing various aspects of the data,we seek to identify trends,make data driven recommendation and gain a deeper understanding of the company's performance.

This workbook contains seven wooksheets, the raw dirty data, the cleaned version and others containing extracts from the cleaned version which were used to create charts to derive useful information from the data.

Power Query was used to clean the data while microsoft excel tools were used for creating the tables ,charts and the interactive dashboard which summarizes the results of the analysis.

### Exploratory Data Analysis

### Observations
There is a drop in the total sales from year 2013 to year 2014 but a gradual increase in the 2015 with the highest sales being in the year 2016 (around the end of the year) and there are no consistent peaks and dips in sales over the months but there is an overall growth in the performance of the sales in the most recent year. The number of orders steadily increased over the years even with the fall and rise in sales over the months(and years).
Majority of the customers are consumers followed by home officers then corporate.
Looking at the shipment mode workbook, most people prefer the standard class and it has the highest number of traffic and sales, followed by second class then first class and same day.
The lowest sales are on tuesdays, wednesdays and fridays.
### Recommendations
I suggest sales from home office and corporate customers can be increased by giving them discount offers based on their increased frequency of patronage.
Discount offers or bonuses can be set on paricular days of the week, like the days with the least sales.
Other factors asides the month or day of the year,customer segment and ship mode could be the reasons for the changes observed in the sales over the years. 3a. The company should create review sections in their forms both offline and online where customers can rate their service and complain about any dissatisfaction, and areas that can need improvements. This will help in gaining some insights focusing on reduced number of customers over the years once they are recorded in the company data. 3b. The company should also track and document the due delivery date and the actually date the comodities got delivered. 3c. The comodities shipped should also be categorised and recorded along with the shipment rate per category and shipment mode. All these should enable the derivation of more indepth insight into the factors affecting sales over years in the company
Good recording keeping is a very crucial for analyzing company data. I encourage that this should always be ensured by the company.
